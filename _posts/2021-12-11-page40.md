Note that Left-Wing protesters are slightly different in this continuity, you can find their national anthem here: this was the calling cry of a militant group of left-wing extremists that sought the total evacuation of France and Japan politicians and military forces.

[They Left Behind Rice And Water: Un Fraponic Hymn](https://lwflouisa.github.io/SRWeaverPoetry/2021/11/16/LaHymneDeFraponic.html)

## THEY LEFT BEHIND RICE AND WATER
In land of rice / and fields, by night<br />
The red rising sun wanes / the cherry blossoms falling<br />
cover all the salt / under moonlit<br />
night, come my hunger. / Take me down Ankou.

When their army / came and went off<br />
we still hungered away / on cherry blossoms falling.<br />
But one day morning / when the rain fell,<br />
The salt washed all away / flowers grew again,<br />
With my sacrifice and / all my hunger pain,

Let my love for Ankou, not be in vain.<br />
Let my love for Ankou, not be in vain.

Nous avons de riz avec sel noir,<br />
Nous avons de riz avec sel noir.

Now we hold the flag / of the big red sun,<br />
with red, white, and / blue flowing rivers.<br />
With flag in hand it is our conventent.<br />
To not banish outcasts to another land.

And not fullfill our mother’s demand,<br />
from the land of black sand.
